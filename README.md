# VideoGameSalesExploratoryDataAnalysis
Goal is to analyze dataset via various exploratory data analysis. I will be using Seaborn and Plotly. The plotly graphs are not visible but the code is available for viewers to run the code for a pie chart, total bar chart and a dropdown option bar graph for every platform available.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
